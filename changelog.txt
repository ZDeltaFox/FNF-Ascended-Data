<b>Ascended BETA v13.2
* Hold arrows, they are functional at the moment only with the keyboard, but I am implementing touch support.
* New converter, I have redone the converter, using a script similar to that of FNF and through Regex, modify and solve "compatibility" errors, and then load it and modify certain arrays, which will be saved in a .dat file
* Support for some secondary animations (when you miss an arrow).
* Pause menu.
* Streaks.
* Fix some performance issues.
* Fixed an issue where the game would desync if you left it in the background, now open the pause menu to prevent that.
* The arrows now disappear after 0.1 sec, after finishing their course, eliminating the progress of the streak and lowering score and life points, before they remained, greatly reducing performance.
